# Stakeholder Memo — ESG Fund Transparency Analyzer  

## Problem  
Investors want confidence that ESG-labeled funds align with their stated sustainability goals. However, fund disclosures are often dense, inconsistent, and infrequent. As a result, many investors cannot easily see whether the holdings in a fund actually support its ESG mandate.  

## Why It Matters  
Misaligned holdings undermine investor trust and may expose portfolios to reputational or thematic risks. For socially conscious retail investors, a lack of transparency leads to uncertainty and potential misallocation of capital. A clear, comparable transparency score would help investors make more informed decisions when selecting funds.  

## Proposed Solution  
1. **Ingest fund holdings** (weights, tickers, sectors) from public disclosures.  
2. **Join with ESG metrics** such as carbon intensity, controversy levels, and revenue from excluded sectors.  
3. **Apply a scoring rubric** that produces a transparency score (0–100) with sub-scores for each criterion.  
4. **Generate a scorecard** that highlights outlier holdings (e.g., high fossil fuel revenue, severe controversies) and explains why they conflict with the ESG label.  

## Stakeholder Impact  
- **Retail Investors:** Gain a simple, data-backed score to compare ESG funds and identify potential “greenwashing.”  
- **Financial Advisors:** Can incorporate transparency scores into client recommendations.  
- **Fintech Platforms:** May integrate the analyzer as a feature to enhance user trust and differentiate their services.  

## Next Steps  
- Develop a prototype notebook to demonstrate fund-level scoring.  
- Expand data sources to include multiple ESG datasets.  
- Test rubric flexibility so investors can adjust weights (e.g., stricter fossil fuel exclusions).
